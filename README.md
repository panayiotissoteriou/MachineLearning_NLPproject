Movie genre classification using Natural Language Processing

In this project we used a variety of NLP methods to classify movies according to their genres, based upon the summaries of their plots. We collected and preprocessed the movie summaries and associated genres, and using bag-of-words and word embeddings approaches, we employed crude, namely naive Bayes, and refined machine learning methods, such as Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression, for the task of text classification.
