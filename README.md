In this project we used a variety of NLP methods to classify movies according to their genres, based on the summaries of their plots. We collected and preprocessed the movie summaries and associated genres, we employed word embedding approaches and machine learning methods, namely Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression, for the task of text classification.
